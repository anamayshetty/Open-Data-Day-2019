# Open-Data-Day-2019
This is a project I did for the inaugural Cambridge Open Data day. We were supposed to use open data sources to solve pressing social problems.

My team decided that a good thing to do was to pull weather data from the Cambridge Computer Science Lab to help people understand how the weather was changing locally to them in Cambridge.
